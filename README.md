# Ubuntu install scripts, for Pop!_OS

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Pop!\_OS._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested with Pop!_OS 20.04.

Happy (re-)installing!

## Easy download

    wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/popos-20.04.tar.gz | tar xzv
    cd ubuntu-install-scripts-popos-20.04
